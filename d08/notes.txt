Containers:
-Container are data structures that store and manage collections of objects.
-They are part of the STL (Standard Template Library)
-They are divided into 2 categories: Sequence containers & Associative containers
-Category 1: Sequence containers: maintain the order of the elements as they are inserted.
	-vector: dynamic array
	-deque : doubly-ended queue
	-list  : doubly-linked list
	-forward list : singly-linked list 
-Category 2: Associative containers: store elements in a sorted order depending on keys :
	-set: stores a collection of unique keys in a sorted order.
	-map: stores a key-value pairs in a sorted order.
	-unordered_set: stores unique keys in a hash table for fast access
	-unordered_map: stores key_value pairs in a hash table for fast access
