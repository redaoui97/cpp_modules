Casting in cpp:
1-Static cast
2-Dynamic cast
3-Const cast
4-Reinterpret cast

1-static cast: Compile time cast, implicitly converts types
    e.g int a = 42;
        double b = static_cast<double>(a);
    -Could be used for : 
        -numeric conversions;
        -enum conversions;
        -Pointer and reference conversions (for related classes)
        -Pointer to void pointer conversions
